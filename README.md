Exploring Salary Predictions : An In depth Analysis using Polynomial Regression &amp; Cross Validation - Data Ana;ytics

 Utilized Pandas, NumPy & scikit-learn libraries in python to conduct a thorough analysis of salary predictions through Polynomial
Regression & Cross-Validation.
 Implemented K-Fold Cross-Validation (K-Fold) techniques to assess Polynomial Regression models across degrees 1 to 5.
 Evaluated model performance using specific accuracy metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Absolute Error (MAE) & R-
squared.
 Visualized average metrics through Matplotlib subplots to enhance the interpretability of model performance.
 Carefully selected the best model based on accuracy metrics (Avg. R-squared Value: 0.6518), to predict salaries based on input.
